This branch of the project is currently under development, if you try to use it now you will probably hate me, I suggest you to wait for a first release.

# SpeedTest

A simple __JavaScript-only__ script which can measures various aspects of your current connection. It can estimate your upload/download bandwidth and your latency. Keep in mind that these estimations are only valid on the HTTP protocol and also between the server and the client you use for testing, it may change with another protocol/server/client.
